This notebook contains solutions to three distinct problems, each tackling different challenges related to genetic algorithms, crossover operations, and Hamming distance. Below is a description of each problem and its respective solution. üéØ

### **Problem 1: Bitwise Mutation**  
The first problem simulates a mutation process on a given chromosome represented as a string of binary digits. The objective is to *randomly flip* a specified bit in the chromosome to simulate mutation, which is a common operation in genetic algorithms. The solution takes an input chromosome and mutates a specific position, ensuring the mutation process is localized and controlled.

#### **Solution Highlights**:

- The function takes in a binary string (*chromosome*) and a position to mutate.
- It flips the bit at the given position by changing *'0'* to *'1'* or vice versa.
- This operation mimics the mutation process in genetic evolution, where changes to the chromosome can lead to new traits. üß¨

### **Problem 2: Genetic Crossover**  
In this problem, two chromosomes (represented as binary strings) undergo crossover, where sections of the two chromosomes are swapped between them at specified loci (positions). This is a common process in genetic algorithms to create new offspring by combining traits from both parents.

#### **Solution Highlights**:

- The function performs crossover by splitting each chromosome into three parts: the portion before the crossover section, the crossover section itself, and the portion after the crossover.
- The crossover section of the two chromosomes is swapped, creating two new chromosomes.
- The result shows the visual difference between the original and the crossed chromosomes, providing clear insight into the crossover process. üîÄ

### **Problem 3: Hamming Distance Calculation**  
The third problem deals with computing the Hamming distance between pairs of binary strings. The Hamming distance is the number of positions where the corresponding bits differ between two strings of equal length. This metric is useful for measuring how different two solutions are, which is essential in error detection, coding theory, and genetic diversity assessment.

#### **Solution Highlights**:

- The solution defines a function to compute the Hamming distance between two binary strings by comparing them bit by bit.
- It calculates the Hamming distance between three pairs of chromosomes.
- The results display the differences between each pair of binary strings, aiding in understanding how similar or different the chromosomes are. üîç

Each of these problems represents key components of genetic algorithms, demonstrating mutation, crossover, and genetic diversity evaluation through Hamming distance calculation. These concepts are vital for optimization techniques in various fields, including artificial intelligence and evolutionary computation. üåê
